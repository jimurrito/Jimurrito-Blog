### **James Immer**
I am a Cloud Solutions Architect, Customer Services Specialist, and Systems Engineer. I love working with customers, and helping break through blockers they may have. I have been working in customer service for 10+ years, and have not had a customer who I could not reason with. Primarily interfacing with customers via consultant and sales roles.

I am always interested in challenging new issues, and technologies. I have a passion for Automation and software design. Primarily working in Powershell/Python/Rust/Haskell/Elixir/C#/Zig. I build applications to utilize Docker, and Cloud-based IAAS/PAAS Services. 

My hobbies include hiking, programing, 3D printing, and listening to Audiobooks.
